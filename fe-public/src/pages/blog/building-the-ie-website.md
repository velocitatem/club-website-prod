This blog highlights some insights from our path of building the IE website.

# Devlog
After talking about the website with the team, we decided to use [Astro](https://astro.build/) as our static site generator. Astro is a new static site generator that uses React as its templating language. It also has a lot of cool features like partial hydration, which allows us to only hydrate the parts of the page that need to be interactive. This is great for performance and accessibility. We also talked about the internal website which will be built using Vue.js. We decided to use Vue.js because it is a framework that we are all familiar with and it is also very easy to use. We also decided to use TailwindCSS as our CSS framework because it is very easy to use and it is also very customizable.
