It features a prototype using a webcam to recognize facial expressions and translate them into simple emojis, aiding those with autism in understanding social cues. Using OpenCV and DeepFace for real-time emotion detection, the plan is to integrate this into Pepper, our lab's robot, for enhanced emotional communication via its display. Challenges include ensuring real-time accuracy, privacy, emotional sensitivity, minimizing biases, and incorporating feedback from the autism community.",
